## Manually Approve Story

Stories flagged for moderation are save in `episodes/raw/dirty` in an unprocessed state.  You can manually approve them add add to processing queue by hiting the `POST /addStory` endpoint.

Example of manually approving a story that failed a moderation check:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @DIRTY-2023-04-01T00-39-08.425Z-039-codegeassanimefan.json http://localhost:3000/addStory
```

Or if moderation endpoint fails due to an API error, the story is saved in an manual review inbox.  Here is an example:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @episodes/raw/inbox/2023-04-01T00-39-08.425Z-039-codegeassanimefan.json http://localhost:3000/addStory
```

you'll need to manually mark it as complete.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/markPlayed?user=feddric0
```

```bash
curl -H "x-twitch-user: REPLACE_USER" -H "x-prompt: REPLACE_PROMPT" http://localhost:3000/addPrompt
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @episodes/raw/manual-prompt.json http://localhost:3000/addPromptManual
```

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @episodes/raw/manual-prompt.json http://localhost:3000/continue
```
